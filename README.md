# That Radio Player

That Radio Player is an HTML5 webapp that uses the `<audio>` tag to stream (web) radios on a mobile phone. It has been originally developed for Safari on iOS 4.3 but I updated it for iOS 13.3.1. It is optimized for a mobile phone screen but also works well on an iPad or on macOS using Safari. I haven't tested other web browsers.

This webapp is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No code is executed server-side.

If you want to run your own version, you should first edit the radio presets to replace `.m3u` links with direct links to the streaming servers of your favorite radio stations.
